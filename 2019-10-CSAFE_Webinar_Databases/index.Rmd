## Additional Variables and Replicates

For some measurement methods, additional variables were considered, such as:

- Type of motion (walking, jumping, careful rollstep for full sole coverage)

- Equipment setup (turntable vs. handheld 3d scanning)

<br/><br/>

For most measurement methods, at least two replicates were recorded at each timepoint
