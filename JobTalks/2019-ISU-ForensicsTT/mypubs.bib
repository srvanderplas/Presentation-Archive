	abstract = {Graphics are very effective for communicating numerical information quickly and efficiently, but many of the design choices we make are based on subjective measures, such as personal taste or conventions of the discipline rather than objective criteria. We briefly introduce perceptual principles such as preattentive features and gestalt heuristics, and then discuss the design and results of a factorial experiment examining the effect of plot aesthetics such as color and trend lines on participants' assessment of ambiguous data displays. The quantitative and qualitative experimental results strongly suggest that plot aesthetics have a significant impact on the perception of important features in data displays. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

	abstract = {Graphical representations have to be true to the data they display. Computational tools ensure this on a technical level. But we also need to take "flaws" of the human perceptual system into account. The sine illusion provides an example where human perception leads to systematic bias in the assessment of the optical stimulus, with a particularly notable impact on perception of time-series data with a seasonal component. In this article, we discuss the reasons for the illusion and various strategies useful to break the illusion or reduce its strength. We demonstrate the presence of the illusion in real-world and theoretical situations. We also present data from a user study, which demonstrate the dramatic effect the sine illusion can have on conclusions drawn from displayed data.},
